# Online Car Insurance: Predicting coverage features customers will buy

As customers shop for a car insurance policy, they visit websites of multiple insurance companies to generate a number of quotes before purchasing a plan. Once the customer starts generating quotes on an insurers website, they may choose many different coverage options before arriving at their ultimate purchase option. Each revision thatâ€™s required, increases the probability of losing the customer. 

**Allstate Insurance** would like to develop a **predictive model** that can predict the coverage plan that the customer would eventually buy. If the eventual purchase can be predicted sooner in the shopping window, the quoting process is shortened and the company is less likely to lose the customer's business.
